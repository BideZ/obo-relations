Technically, it connects the IRI of these entities. The 'non-logical' aspect means they are ignored for reasoning purposes. They are primarily used for metadata: labels, definitions, synonyms, attribution, notes and comments, etc. See the OWL Primer for more details. Annotation Properties in RO RO makes use of annotation properties from other ontologies (e.g. RDFS, IAO) and in addition defines annotation properties that can be used in other ontologies. See flat list of RO annotation properties in OntoBee Or start from a root annotation property, e.g. http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002416 In RO we aim to have comprehensive metadata for each ObjectProperty declared. In practice we often fall short, but this is something we are striving to improve. Metadata is provided via annotation assertions using annotation properties (APs), and other object types, from a variety of ontologies, including: IAO/metadata dublin core RDFS OboInOwl We have also defined APs within RO.

We leave open the possibility of generalizing to allow p or q to be qualities. Formulation Our causal algebra is essentially a cross-product of more basic components: T : An Interval Algebra I : A simple set of influence types D : Directionalities The named relations are drawn from T x I x D T: Interval Algebra Note that RO already contains temporal relations for ordering occurrents. This is different from the Allen Algebra, as we take different relations as primitive. I: Influence Influence pertains to whether or not the causal relation is regulatory; direction pertains to the directionality of the change of magnitude of the target. The influence is either regulatory or non-regulatory I = {R,N} A regulatory influence (R) is a causal relation that can be switched on or off to achieve some objective: for example, a cell regulating levels of a cytosolic chemical through the switching off of a GTPase with a GTPase inhibitor. A non-regulatory influence (N) is the complement of this, and is exemplified by two successive steps in a pathway, where the output of the first is required as input for the second. Although the relationship is causal, it is not regulatory as the required input for the second step is not purposefully withheld (or provided); the cell does not use this as a control mechanism. (Note that we assume influence one way or another; the algebra does not permit non-influential/causal relations; these could be done separately using Allen). The following primitive rules hold: R o R \u2192 R R o N \u2192 R N o R \u2192 R N o N \u2192 N i.e. regulation is \u2018infectious\u2019. Note this may seem excessively permissive: a single regulatory link in a very long chain of causal relations renders the entire chain causal. We leave it to individual applications to determine both the degree of causal influence and the extend to which a regulatory component contributes. This may be via probabilistic or quantitive reasoning. This is outside the scope of this symbolic boolean algebra which seeks merely to determine logical potential. Direction The direction is positive, negative or undeclared/neutral/generic Direction = {+1, -1, 0} Although all actual regulatory relationships have a direction, we include the zero state here to assist with defining a formalism that accounts for unknown states. The primitive property chains are obtained through arithmetic multiplication; e.g. +1 \u2218 +1 \u2192 +1 +1 \u2218 -1 \u2192 -1 -1 \u2218 +1 \u2192 -1 -1 \u2218 -1 \u2192 +1 0 \u2218 _ \u2192 0 _ \u2218 0 \u2192 0 Here \u2018_\u2019 is a wildcard, and direction can be inserted. Directness For any pair of atomic activities p and q, if p has some causal influence on q then it can only stand in two possible directness relationships to q D (aka direct): if there is a physical interaction involving participants of p and q I (aka indirect): p precedes q, if there is NO physical interaction involving participants of p and q Cross-Product Our set of causal relations is therefore drawn from T \u00d7 I \u00d7 D The following names are used for members of the cross-product directly positively regulates \u2192 <D,R,+1> directly negatively regulates \u2192 <D,R,-1> indirectly positively regulates \u2192 <I,R,+1> indirectly negatively regulates \u2192 <I,R,-1> regulates \u2192 <*,R,0> positively regulates \u2192 <*,R,+1> negatively regulates \u2192 <*,R,-1> directly provides input for \u2192 <D,N,+1> indirectly provides input for \u2192 <I,N,+1> provides input for \u2192 <*,N,+1> immediately causally upstream of \u2192 <D,*,0> TODO: add PURLs for the above.

Note that many of the differences described here were originally announced on the RO and BFO lists Differences Identifiers / IRIs OBO_REL used identifiers of the form \"OBO_REL:part_of\", which were translated to URIs of the form http://obofoundry.org/ro#part_of RO follows the obofoundry ID policy and uses numeric identifiers with corresponding IRIs of the form http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_nnnnnnn See Identifiers for more details Ceding of relations to BFO We have ceded some core relations to BFO, where they are generic and are required to define BFO classes. Examples: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050 is part of (replaces OBO_REL:part_of) These relations were intended to be part of BFO1.2 -- however, this version of BFO was never formally released, and BFO2 instead used temporalized relations. Relations such as BFO:0000050 are now managed within RO, rather than BFO, despite the ID. See ROAndBFO for more information. Elimination of class-level relationships The original OBO_REL followed the Genome Biology paper in defining relations as class-level. However, these class-level relations caused a lot of confusion and are not really required - in OWL (and in OBO-Format, which is a subset of OWL) we have instance level relationships that are quantified (e.g. finger SubClassOf part_of some hand). RO makes a clean break with OBO_REL, and abandons class level relations. For a discussion of how RO aligns with OBO_REL in terms of temporal quantification, see ROAndTime . An exception is made for a small number of \"macro\" relations such as RO_0002161 (never in taxon), which is modeled as an annotation property and expanded to a more complex OWL statement using an OWL macro expansion engine.

The intuition is that characteristics of the parent should be inherited as characteristics of the child. In fact this is not the case: the direct form of a transitive relation is both a subproperty of the transitive form, and itself non-transitive.

For example, if Ontology O1 has: BloodPressure EquivalentTo pressure and quality-of some blood And Ontology O2 has: Individual: bp001 Types: pressure and inheres-in some blood then bp001 will NOT be inferred to be an instance of BloodPressure Of course, inferences over subPropertyOf will be complete. i.e. we can infer the super property from the sub property, just not the reverse.

This means that if different ontologies are to work together then they must all agree on a particular level, otherwise inferences will be incomplete. For example, if Ontology O1 has: BloodPressure EquivalentTo pressure and quality-of some blood And Ontology O2 has: Individual: bp001 Types: pressure and inheres-in some blood then bp001 will NOT be inferred to be an instance of BloodPressure Of course, inferences over subPropertyOf will be complete. i.e. we can infer the super property from the sub property, just not the reverse.

This can be disconcerting, especially as (for logical reasons), the hierarchies can be mingled. For example, sub-relations of generic relations 'part of' or 'precedes' include specific neuroanatomical relations mixed with environmental relations. In general, typical users would not be exposed to this variety: a neuroanatomist should consume a RO module intended specifically for neuroanatomy. This section deals with how RO is organized into domains, and how these modules are extracted. Imports RO imports a handful of portions of other ontologies, primarily in order to specify domain and range constraints. In practice, some external ontologies are not properly imported: portions of the ontologies are copied directly into RO. This is something we will resolve in future (TODO tracker link). RO uses BFO classes as an upper level ontology; this is imported from the RO-core module (next section): We currently support two overlapping mechanisms to partition RO into modules according to application or domain. Grouping relations Subsets Grouping relations are OPs (Object Properties) that form the root of a property hierarchy including the desired properties. For example, 'developmentally related to' (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002324) groups all OPs used to specify developmental relationships between two structures. All such grouping relations should be tagged with a 'curator note' property describing the intent of the grouping, and warning not to use the OP in logical assertions. There are some objections to grouping OPs. Philosophically there are objections that the OP does not represent a true relationship in the world. However, in practice there are no negative consequences of this philosophical infelicity - the OP can simply be ignored. A more serious objection may be that the presence of these relations can slow down reasoning. If this turns out to be a problem we may find another strategy. Despite these objections, grouping relations are undeniably convenient for browsing in an ontology browser like Protege. With the grouping strategy, all subproperties are included in the group. Sometimes it is desirable to cherry pick certain OPs independently of the subProperty hierarchy. Here we explicitly assert membership in a group. Currently this is done using the 'in subset' AP (AnnotationProperty) from the OiO vocabulary. This may be changed to IAO in future, but for now use of this vocabulary has advantages for mapping to obo format and making use of OORT to build releases - subset files are generated as part of the release process. Currently we only have a single subset, ro-eco, but we will add more later, e.g. for RONeuro . One possibility is to have an editor in charge of the content of each module (or at least representing a community of stakeholders). The current version of RO includes both general and specific relations from multiple domains. This is not ideal for many users, who typically require a small subset of these. Dividing into domain-specific modules One approach would be to divide the RO into a collection of domain-specific modules - for each ro-neuro, ro-developmental-biology, etc. These modules could import one another where appropriate, and a parent ro ontology could import everything. We decided against this at this stage, since it will difficult to tell a-priori which were sensible divisions. There are many ways to partition into mutually exclusive sets - by upper level (e.g. process-process relations vs process-continuant) or by domain. Many domains overlap. We may still pre-modularize the relations at some stage in the future, but for now they are organized as a single ontology (or rather as two: with the core relations in BFO and derived and domain specific relations in RO) Extracting Modules As the RO is not modularized in advanced, it would be useful for users to have ways to extract the modules they need. Automatic Module Extraction There are a number of ways to automatically extract a module from an ontology - the OWLAPI implements some of these. You can use the OWLTools command line facility to access the OWLAPI and it's modularization capabilities. Using 'develops from' as a seed using the TOP strategy: owltools ro.owl --extract-module -m TOP 'develops from' -o file://`pwd`/ro-subset-part-of.owl Using 'part of' and 'has part' and all their descendant relations: owltools ro.owl --extract-module -m STAR 'has part' 'part of' -o file://`pwd`/ro-subset-part-of.owl Getting the right module requires an understanding of the modularization algorithm which is non-trivial - particularly where this interacts with ShortcutRelations - in future we will provide a more intuitive high-level modularization capability. Manual Module Extraction Another method is to manually take the properties and/or related axioms one requires and copy them into the working ontology. This technique is not ideal, but the operation is relatively infrequent since most ontologies do not use large numbers of relations.

Local Reflexivity In many formal treatments of relations, the Reflexivity characteristic is frequently used. For example, in mereology, 'part of' is frequently characterized as reflexive. This can seem confusing when compared with everyday usage (no one typically considers an object to be part of itself). However, it is convenient from the point of view of mathematical formulation.

For example, a cell can be part of the neuroepithelium at one time, and then detached from it at a later time. This is an important consideration in anatomy ontologies . For a detailed treatment, see the original RO paper . Unfortunately the relations in this paper are difficult to represent directly in OWL. Our current strategy is to use \"atemporal\" binary relations such as part_of with the understanding that the spirit of the RO paper should be followed - i.e. any class axioms such as \"nucleus SubClassOf part_of some cell\" should be understood to hold true for any \"snapshot\" in time. We are currently working on a more formal treatment. One possible approach is to use 'temporalized relations', but this suffers from problems, and the RO is unlikely to adopt these in the near future. See this critique of BFO2 for more details. A more promising approach is either a separate interpretation or TemporallyQualifiedContinuants , but work on this proposal has not yet been completed. Rough Sketch of Approach The spirit of the approach is to treat class axioms in OWL as if they had the same meaning as class-level relations in RO2005. For example: (1) Class: nucleus SubClassOf: part_of some cell Is equivalent to writing the following FOL: (2) forall n : instance_of(n,Nucleus) -> exists c : instance_of(c,Cell) part_of(n,c) But our goal is to provide a temporal interpretation consistent with the original RO paper , as follows: (3) forall t : forall n : instance_of(n,Nucleus,t) -> exists c : instance_of(c,Cell,t) part_of(n,c,t) What is currently lacking are global generic rules that can be applied for any OWL axiom - class axiom or instance axiom. Whilst these are being developed, this rough sketch provides some guidelines. The basic idea for class axioms that use the part_of relation is: assume a \"forall t\" quantifier surrounding the direct FOL translation of the OWL. In addition, the same \"t\" variable should be added for all property assertions where a temporal argument is required. For example, the the OWL class axiom (1) above has the direct meaning: By applying the transformation specified roughly above, we move from (2) to(3). There will be exceptions to this patterns, these will be documented in the relations themselves. Inline Documentation Many RO relations are annotated with a \"temporal interpretation\" property: RO_0001900 \"temporal interpretation\" This connects an OWL object property to documentation describing how the relation should be interpreted. This is best seen from within Protege.

Other examples The Gene Ontology (extended version) contains axioms such as: (1) (part_of some Nucleus) DisjointWith (part_of some mitochondrion) This has a direct interpretation that is atemporal: (2) not exists i, n, m: part_of(i,n) & part_of(i,m) & instance_of(n,Nucleus) & instance_of(m,Mitochondrion) Applying the rule above we get: (3) forall t : [ not exists i, n, m: part_of(i,n,t) & part_of(i,m,t) & instance_of(n,Nucleus,t) & instance_of(m,Mitochondrion,t) ] This is equivalent to saying \"there are no times at which there is anything that is both part of a nucleus and part of a mitochondrion\".

For example, a cell can be part of the neuroepithelium at one time, and then detached from it at a later time. This is an important consideration in anatomy ontologies . For a detailed treatment, see the original RO paper . Unfortunately the relations in this paper are difficult to represent directly in OWL. Our current strategy is to use \"atemporal\" binary relations such as part_of with the understanding that the spirit of the RO paper should be followed - i.e. any class axioms such as \"nucleus SubClassOf part_of some cell\" should be understood to hold true for any \"snapshot\" in time. We are currently working on a more formal treatment. One possible approach is to use 'temporalized relations', but this suffers from problems, and the RO is unlikely to adopt these in the near future. See this critique of BFO2 for more details. A more promising approach is either a separate interpretation or TemporallyQualifiedContinuants , but work on this proposal has not yet been completed.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"temporal-semantics/#rough-sketch-of-approach","text":"The spirit of the approach is to treat class axioms in OWL as if they had the same meaning as class-level relations in RO2005. For example: (1) Class: nucleus SubClassOf: part_of some cell Is equivalent to writing the following FOL: (2) forall n : instance_of(n,Nucleus) -> exists c : instance_of(c,Cell) part_of(n,c) But our goal is to provide a temporal interpretation consistent with the original RO paper , as follows: (3) forall t : forall n : instance_of(n,Nucleus,t) -> exists c : instance_of(c,Cell,t) part_of(n,c,t) What is currently lacking are global generic rules that can be applied for any OWL axiom - class axiom or instance axiom. Whilst these are being developed, this rough sketch provides some guidelines. The basic idea for class axioms that use the part_of relation is: assume a \"forall t\" quantifier surrounding the direct FOL translation of the OWL. In addition, the same \"t\" variable should be added for all property assertions where a temporal argument is required. For example, the the OWL class axiom (1) above has the direct meaning: By applying the transformation specified roughly above, we move from (2) to(3). There will be exceptions to this patterns, these will be documented in the relations themselves.","title":"Rough Sketch of Approach"},{"location":"temporal-semantics/#inline-documentation","text":"Many RO relations are annotated with a \"temporal interpretation\" property: RO_0001900 \"temporal interpretation\" This connects an OWL object property to documentation describing how the relation should be interpreted.
