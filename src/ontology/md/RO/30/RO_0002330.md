 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002330
 * *Label* = genomically related to
 * *Definition* = holds between two entities when some genome-level process such as gene expression is involved. This includes transcriptional, spliceosomal events. These relations can be used between either macromolecule entities (such as regions of nucleic acid) or between their abstract informational counterparts.
