## Class : has phenotype

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002200
 * *Label* = has phenotype
 * *Definition* = A relationship that holds between a biological entity and a phenotype. Here a phenotype is construed broadly as any kind of quality of an organism part, a collection of these qualities, or a change in quality or qualities (e.g. abnormally increased temperature). The subject of this relationship can be an organism (where the organism has the phenotype, i.e. the qualities inhere in parts of this organism), a genomic entity such as a gene or genotype (if modifications of the gene or the genotype causes the phenotype), or a condition such as a disease (such that if the condition inheres in an organism, then the organism has the phenotype).
