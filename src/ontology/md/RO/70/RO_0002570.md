 * *[curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md)* = This relation holds between a thing with a 'conduit' (e.g. a bone foramen) and a 'conduee' (for example, a nerve) such that at the time the relationship holds, the conduee has two ends sticking out either end of the conduit. It should therefore note be used for objects that move through the conduit but whose spatial extent does not span the passage. For example, it would not be used for a mountain that contains a long tunnel through which trains pass. Nor would we use it for a digestive tract and objects such as food that pass through.
