 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002418
 * *Label* = causally upstream of or within
 * *Definition* = p 'causally upstream or within' q iff (1) the end of p is before the end of q and (2) the execution of p exerts some causal influence over the outputs of q; i.e. if p was abolished or the outputs of p were to be modified, this would necessarily affect q.
